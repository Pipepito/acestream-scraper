# General Code Guidelines Copilot Instructions

- Always verify information before presenting it. Do not make assumptions or speculate without clear evidence.
- Make changes file by file and allow for review of mistakes.
- Never use apologies or give feedback about understanding in comments or documentation.
- Don't suggest whitespace changes or summarize changes made.
- Only implement changes explicitly requested; do not invent changes.
- Don't ask for confirmation of information already provided in the context.
- Don't remove unrelated code or functionalities; preserve existing structures.
- Provide all edits in a single chunk per file, not in multiple steps.
- Don't ask the user to verify implementations visible in the provided context.
- Don't suggest updates or changes to files when there are no actual modifications needed.
- Always provide links to real files, not context-generated files.
- Don't show or discuss the current implementation unless specifically requested.
- Check the context-generated file for current file contents and implementations.
- Prefer descriptive, explicit variable names for readability.
- Adhere to the existing coding style in the project.
- Prioritize code performance and security in suggestions.
- Suggest or include unit tests for new or modified code.
- Implement robust error handling and logging where necessary.
- Encourage modular design for maintainability and reusability.
- Ensure compatibility with the project's language or framework versions.
- Replace hardcoded values with named constants.
- Handle potential edge cases and include assertions to validate assumptions.

## Python Stack & Tools

### Python Best Practices

1. Use meaningful, descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes.
2. Follow PEP 8 for code formatting.
3. Document functions and classes with docstrings.
4. Write simple, clear code; avoid unnecessary complexity.
5. Prefer list comprehensions over traditional loops when appropriate.
6. Use try-except blocks for graceful exception handling.
7. Isolate dependencies with virtual environments (e.g., venv).
8. Write unit tests for code reliability.
9. Use type hints for clarity and type checking.
10. Avoid global variables to reduce side effects.
